# Housing Price Predicting Model
Model to predict housing prices, using data from Australia

## Getting Started
This code has been directly pushed from Colaboratory, Google's research tool for Machine Learning and research.

## Running Code in Colaboratory
To run a project in Colaboratory, you have to run cell by cell, in order, making sure that all objects have been declared and instantiated in the current runtime

## Tools
We used tensorflow and keras to build the model, pandas for data structures and other analysis, numpy, and other sklearn packages like OneHotEncoder and MinMaxScaler
