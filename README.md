# Housing Price Predicting Model
Model to predict housing prices, using data from Australia

## Getting Started
This code has been directly pushed from Colaboratory, Google's research tool for Machine Learning and research.

HousingMarketPrediction.ipynb is the file that contains the code for the model which, again, is pushed directly from Colaboratory.

## Running Code in Colaboratory
To run a project in Colaboratory, you have to run cell by cell, in order, making sure that all objects have been declared and instantiated in the current runtime

## Tools
We used tensorflow and keras to build the model, pandas for data structures and other analysis, numpy, and other sklearn packages like OneHotEncoder and MinMaxScaler
